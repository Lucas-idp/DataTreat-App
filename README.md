This code is an app that allows the user to import a time series data, oriented to accelerations, displacement and deformation data, and it have functions that are aimed at vibration analysis:
Upon running the code the user is presented with a window. 
The dropdown menu in the top left corner is used to set the x-axis for the subplots and operations.
The checkboxes picked define the y-axes to be used in the subplots and operations.

Features:
- Multiplot of severial time series with sync zoom for detailed analysis. ("Plot selected Data")
- Power Spectral Density calculations. ("PSD")
- Evaluation of acceleration data according confort standards ISO2631. ("Param. ISO 2631")
- solution of the 2GDL response of motorcycle chassi based on wheel excitation, pilot weight, cargo and general dimentions are inputs the user must give. ("Resposta 2GDL")
- Minimize VDV (Vibration Dose Value - ISO2631) varying geometric characteristics of rear suspension. ("Otimizar param suspens√£o")
- Script allows for creating new data files based on a time interval on the original readings. ("Slice Data")
- Accepts .BIN files generated by CATMAN (shout out to LEON BOHMANN for providing us with Apread, the library that allows readting .BIN files) it also reads .CSV files.
